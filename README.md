### Overview of the statistical analysis:

There is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Summary visualizations:

### Checkout Timnes for Users

Trip duration peaks at 5 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender
![](https://github.com/akmilton11/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout_Times_by_Gender.PNG)
The checkout time is heavily favored by "Male". While the "Female" checkout time is less, the tripduration affects all genders the same.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

Trips are heaviest during early morning and late afternoon for the weekday and late mornings and early afternoons for the weekends. 

### Trips by Gender

Number of trips are heaviest around 8AM, 5PM, and 6PM between all the genders.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

Subscribes peak on Thursday for both Male and Female, while customers peak on the weekends.

Top starting and ending locations seem to have a strong correlation with the larger and darker circles matching up against each other. It would be wise for the program in Des Moines to be centrally located seeing as they have a smaller population.

### Summary:
With this data the Des Moines bike sharing program could get going! The biggest difference is the population density. This is one of the first suggestions I'd like to make. They will need to map out the population and place their bike sharing stations near the bulk of the population or perhaps the universities. The second discrepancy would be space, in the city using a bike for 5 minutes might be very easy, but in a large venue - the trip duration might be longer. They will need to consider trip duration in a rural area - perhaps breakout it out by gender as well. The program can be successful if they are centrally located in the larger populated areas and the additional stations are two sparsely spread out.
